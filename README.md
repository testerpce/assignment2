This is the Neural Network Language model. We have used LSTM based networks.

The 2 folders word_level and char_level contain the character level and the word level models. 

In each case, we need to first run the train_char.py or train_word.py models.

This generates the models required.

Finally we can run generate.py or run the bash file by typing the command without the quotes "sh generate_sentence.sh".
